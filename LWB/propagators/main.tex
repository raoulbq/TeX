\section{Time Propagation of Quantum Wave Packets}
\label{sec:timeprop}
%

All based on composition methods
methods that compose elementary flows/operators to build an approximation of high order

how does one analytically propagate?
operators don't commute
operator splitting to the rescue
Hamiltonian

\begin{align}
	\opH = \opT + \opV = \opT + \opU + \opW
\end{align}
\begin{align}
	\opT &= - \sum_{j=1}^D \frac{\eps^2}{2m_j} \frac{\del^2}{\del x_j^2} \\
	\opV &= V(x)
\end{align}

For the rest of this report, it will be used that $\opU = U(\bvec{x})$ and $\opW = W(\bvec{x})$ and they will denote the quadratic and non-quadratic splitting of $\opV$ respectively.

Hagedorn wavepackets explained in \cite{FGL_semiclassical_dynamics}

The solution to the Schrödinger equation can be approximated as a finite linear combination if Hagedorn function \cite{FGL_semiclassical_dynamics}
\begin{align}
	\label{math:hagedornwp}
	\psi(x,t) \approx u(x,t)
	= e^{\im S(t)/\eps} \sum_{k \in \K} c_k(t) \varphi_k^\eps [ q(t),p(t),Q(t),P(t) ] (x)
\end{align}

$\K$ finite multi index set

As the idea behind the splitting the Hamiltonian operator is so central to the time propagation approach used here, we repeat the most important findings from  \cite{FGL_semiclassical_dynamics}:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The free linear Schrödinger equation ($\opV=0$) can be solved exactly and the wavepacket remains in Hagedorn wavepacket form~\ref{math:hagedornwp}.
		For time propagation, only the parameters $\bvec{\Pi},S$ need to be updated, the coefficients $\{c_k\}_{k \in \K}$ remain unchanged.
	\item The Schrödinger equation~\ref{math:tdse} can be solved exactly in a pure quadratic potential, i.e. in a potential $\opV=U(\bvec{x})$ with $\opT=0$.
		Again, time propagation only affects the parameters $\bvec{\Pi},S$, not the coefficients $\{c_k\}_{k \in \K}$.
	\item In the case of an arbitrary potential $\opV = W(\bvec{x})$ that is not quadratic, a set of Galerkin functions can be propagated by adapting the coefficients $\{c_k\}_{k \in \K}$ without changing the parameters $\bvec{\Pi},S$.
\end{itemize}

	
Small semiclassical parameter $\eps$ plays an important role in the stability of numerical schemes

Classical dynamics in the limit $\eps \rightarrow 0$, quantum mechanics for $\eps = 1$.

In particular, as underlined in \cite{GH_convsemiclassical}, a small parameter $\eps$ can often impose severe constraints on the step size of splitting methods and significantly increase the error. For example, the error was shown to be proportional to $\sim \eps^{-2})$ for Lie-Trotter splitting, Strang splitting and other related methods.

Motivation - why is time propagation important?
Background


The Hamiltonian is split into three parts
where $\opU(\bvec{q}(t),\bvec{x})$ is the second order Taylor approximation of the potential $\opV$ around $\bvec{q}(t)$ and $\opW(\bvec{q}(t),\bvec{x})$ is the corresponding remainder.

$\opV = V(\bvec{x}) = U(\bvec{q},\bvec{x}) + W(\bvec{q},\bvec{x})$

\begin{align}
	U(\bvec{q},\bvec{x}) &:= V(\bvec{q}) + \nabla V(\bvec{q}) (\bvec{x}-\bvec{q})
	+ \frac{1}{2} (\bvec{x}-\bvec{q})^T \nabla^2 V(\bvec{q}) (\bvec{x}-\bvec{q}) \\
	W(\bvec{q},\bvec{x}) &:= V(\bvec{x}) - U(\bvec{q},\bvec{x})
\end{align}

The kinetic part $\opT$ and the quadratic part of the potential $\opU$ can be integrated exactly (see \cite{FGL_semiclassical_dynamics}).


The search for accurate time propagation schemes has become an area of research by itself, see papers of A and B

\section{Implementation in C++}

\begin{comment}
\cite{libwaveblocks}
What was the main challenge? What was controllable (which code could be changed), what not? 
Quick alternating o

The challenges were twofold: 
First, identifying of all the common basic building blocks and expressing all algorithms in terms of these components
Second, implementing all basic building blocks in a generic but efficient manner
Third, minimize the overhead for switching between function calls

 - encapsulate the functionality in a clean interface without loosing flexibility and 
 - write efficient/fast code

Tell how each of these challenges were overcome


Motivation of software design choices

	- Why class structure/inheritance (explain hierarchy)
	- CRTP / static polymorphism \cite{C_CRTP}
	- recognizing IP
	- callback function
	- implementation of IntSplit (TU,UT, partial specialization)
	- polymorphism through enable-if
