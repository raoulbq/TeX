Semiclassical time-dependent Schrödinger equation
%
\begin{align}
	\label{math:tdse}
	\im \eps \; \del_t \psi (\bvec{x},t) = \opH (\eps) \; \psi (\bvec{x},t)
\end{align}
%
with wave function $\psi(\bvec{x},t)$ depending on the spatial variables $\bvec{x} = (x_1,\dots,x_D) \in \R^D$ and the time variable $t \in \R$.

Hamiltonian
\begin{align}
	\opH = \opT + \opV = \opT + \opU + \opW
\end{align}
\begin{align}
	\opT &= - \sum_{j=1}^D \frac{\eps^2}{2m_j} \frac{\del^2}{\del x_j^2} \\
	\opV &= V(x)
\end{align}

Small semiclassical parameter $\eps$ plays an important role in the stability of numerical schemes

Classical dynamics in the limit $\eps \rightarrow 0$, quantum mechanics for $\eps = 1$.

In particular, as underlined in \cite{GH_convsemiclassical}, a small parameter $\eps$ can often impose severe constraints on the step size of splitting methods and significantly increase the error. For example, the error was shown to be proportional to $\sim \eps^{-2})$ for Lie-Trotter splitting, Strang splitting and other related methods.

Motivation - why is time propagation important?
Background

Describe what is going to happen in the rest of the paper


Hagedorn wavepackets explained in \cite{FGL_semiclassical_dynamics}

The solution to the Schrödinger equation can be approximated as a finite linear combination if Hagedorn function \cite{FGL_semiclassical_dynamics}
\begin{align}
	\label{math:hagedornwp}
	\psi(x,t) \approx u(x,t)
	= e^{\im S(t)/\eps} \sum_{k \in \K} c_k(t) \varphi_k^\eps [ q(t),p(t),Q(t),P(t) ] (x)
\end{align}

$\K$ finite multi index set

As the idea behind the splitting the Hamiltonian operator is so central to the time propagation approach used here, we repeat the most important findings from  \cite{FGL_semiclassical_dynamics}:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The free linear Schrödinger equation ($\opV=0$) can be solved exactly and the wavepacket remains in Hagedorn wavepacket form \ref{math:hagedornwp}.
		For time propagation, only the parameters $\bvec{\Pi},S$ need to be updated, the coefficients $\{c_k\}_{k \in \K}$ remain unchanged.
	\item The Schrödinger equation \ref{math:tdse} can be solved exactly in a pure quadratic potential, i.e. in a potential $\opV=U(\bvec{x})$ with $\opT=0$.
		Again, time propagation only affects the parameters $\bvec{\Pi},S$, not the coefficients $\{c_k\}_{k \in \K}$.
	\item In the case of an arbitrary potential $\opV = W(\bvec{x})$ that is not quadratic, a set of Galerkin functions can be propagated by adapting the coefficients $\{c_k\}_{k \in \K}$ without changing the parameters $\bvec{\Pi},S$.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Quantum Time Propagation, Operator Splitting and Hagedorn Propagator}

check propositions in hagedorn paper.

how does one analytically propagate?
operators don't commute
operator splitting to the rescue


The Hamiltonian is split into three parts
where $\opU(\bvec{q}(t),\bvec{x})$ is the second order Taylor approximation of the potential $\opV$ around $\bvec{q}(t)$ and $\opW(\bvec{q}(t),\bvec{x})$ is the corresponding remainder.

$\opV = V(\bvec{x}) = U(\bvec{q},\bvec{x}) + W(\bvec{q},\bvec{x})$

\begin{align}
	U(\bvec{q},\bvec{x}) &:= V(\bvec{q}) + \nabla V(\bvec{q}) (\bvec{x}-\bvec{q})
	+ \frac{1}{2} (\bvec{x}-\bvec{q})^T \nabla^2 V(\bvec{q}) (\bvec{x}-\bvec{q}) \\
	W(\bvec{q},\bvec{x}) &:= V(\bvec{x}) - U(\bvec{q},\bvec{x})
\end{align}

The kinetic part $\opT$ and the quadratic part of the potential $\opU$ can be integrated exactly (see \cite{FGL_semiclassical_dynamics}).


The search for accurate time propagation schemes has become an area of research by itself, see papers of A and B

\subsection{Common building blocks for Quantum Time Propagators}

General notes: what variables are accessible?


The time stepping with operators $\opT$ and $\opV = U(\op{x})$ follows directly from the propositions in \cite{FGL_semiclassical_dynamics} and is outlined in the algorithms \ref{alg:stepT} and \ref{alg:stepU} respectively.

As pointed out in the introduction, the time propagation for non-quadratic potentials $W(\vec{x})$ can be achieved by updating the coefficients $\{ c_k \}_{k \in \K}$.
The update rule is
%
\begin{align}
	\bvec{c}(t) = \exp \left( - \frac{\im t}{\eps} \bmat{F} \right) \bvec{c}(0)
\end{align}
%
where the matrix $\bmat{F} = \{ f_{k,l} \}_{k,l \in \K}$ has entries
%
\begin{align}
	f_{k,l} = \matrixel{\varphi_k}{W}{\varphi_l}
	= \int_{\R^N} \conj{\varphi_k(\bvec{x})} W(\bvec{x}) \varphi_l(\bvec{x}) \; \dif \bvec{x}
\end{align}

\subsection{Hagedorn Propagator}
\label{sub:hagedorn_propagator}
%
The Hagedorn propagator, shown in algorithm \ref{alg:hagedorn}, is one of the simplest propagators that can be built by exploiting the numerical aspects discussed above.
As pointed out in \cite{FGL_semiclassical_dynamics}, this simple time stepping scheme has many beneficial properties like the preservation of the $L^2$ norm of the wavepacket, time reversibility and stability in the classical limit $\eps \rightarrow 0$.
Also, in the limit of $\K$ approaching the full basis set, the variational approximation used for the propagation with the non-quadratic part $\opW$ becomes exact.

		\EndProcedure
	\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}


\subsection{Semiclassical Propagator}
\label{sub:semiclassical_propagator}
%
The central idea of the semiclassical splitting, as introduced in \cite{GH_convsemiclassical},
is to split the propagation with operators $\opT$ and $\opU$ into many smaller, alternating steps, thereby reducing the dominating error\footnote{for small $\eps$,
the main source of error lies in the updating of $\Pi$ and $S$} in the update of $\bvec{\Pi}$ and $S$.
While there is some additional computational cost caused by a higher number of updates for the parameters $\bvec{\Pi}$ and $S$, the extra effort is usually negligible compared to the propagation with $\opW$ which requires numerical evaluation of multi-dimensional integrals. 
\par\medskip
%
In addition, due to the numerical properties of the semiclassical splitting, 
it even allows to take larger timesteps $\Dt$ than conventional
splitting methods like the YL-splitting, while maintaining the same error.
\par\medskip
%
Finally and most importantly, the error is no longer proportional to $1/\eps^2$ but instead
scales linearly in the semiclassical parameter $\eps$,
meaning that a smaller $\eps$ will now reduce the error instead of increasing it.
The error scales with $\eps (\Delta t)^2$ for the semiclassical splitting using the Y-splitting,
but the dependency on the timestep $\Delta t$ can be improved even further by using different
splittings which effectively corresponds to higher order coefficient pairs $w_T$ and $w_U$.
\par\medskip
%
The pseudo-algorithm for the semiclassical propagator is given in \ref{alg:semiclassical} and 
further details can be found in the original paper \cite{GH_convsemiclassical}.

\end{algorithm}


\subsection{Magnus Propagator}
\label{sub:magnus_propagator}
%
As was noted by Magnus in \cite{Magnus1954}, the solution to a differential equation of the form
%
\begin{align}
	y'(t) = a(t) y(t) \qquad t \ge 0
\end{align}
%
can be written as
%
\begin{align}
	y(t) = e^{\sigma (t)} y_0
\end{align}
%
where $\sigma (t)$ is an infinite sum of iterated integrals and commutators, also known as the Magnus series.
\par\medskip
%
In order to approximate this solution, one can take only a finite number of terms from this series whereby a truncation error is committed
(additional error sources in this method are the discretization of integrals and the approximation of matrix exponentials).
%
This method has several beneficial numerical properties that are described in \cite{Iserles1999}.
In particular, for solutions that evolve within a Lie group, the same holds for the approximate numerical solution calculated through a truncated Magnus series. 
It was also shown in the same paper that the Magnus series can compete with - and in fact may even outplay - classical schemes like Runge-Kutta or Gauss-Legendre.
Moreover, the numerical stability and good performance of the Magnus propagator are not limited to problems where the solution evolves within a Lie Group, but also apply to various problems when this is not the case.

\section{Implementation in C++}

\cite{libwaveblocks}
What was the main challenge? What was controllable (which code could be changed), what not? 
Quick alternating o

The challenges were twofold: 
First, identifying of all the common basic building blocks and expressing all algorithms in terms of these components
Second, implementing all basic building blocks in a generic but efficient manner
Third, minimize the overhead for switching between function calls

 - encapsulate the functionality in a clean interface without loosing flexibility and 
 - write efficient/fast code

Tell how each of these challenges were overcome


Motivation of software design choices

	- Why class structure/inheritance (explain hierarchy)
	- CRTP / static polymorphism \cite{C_CRTP}
	- recognizing IP
	- callback function
	- implementation of intSplit (TU,UT, partial specialization)
	- polymorphism through enable-if
