\section{Introduction}

Motivation - why is time propagation important?
Background

\subsection{Quantum Time Propagation and Operator Splitting}

how does one analytically propagate?
operators don't commute
operator splitting to the rescue

The search for accurate time propagation schemes has become an area of research by itself, see papers of A and B

\section{Time evolution schemes}

present a selection of propagators

\subsection{Magnus Propagator}
\subsection{Pre764 Propagator}

\section{Implementation in C++}

What was the main challenge? What was controllable (which code could be changed), what not? 
Quick alternating o

The challenges were twofold: 
First, identifying of all the common basic building blocks and expressing all algorithms in terms of these components
Second, implementing all basic building blocks in a generic but efficient manner
Third, minimize the overhead for switching between function calls

 - encapsulate the functionality in a clean interface without loosing flexibility and 
 - write efficient/fast code

Tell how each of these challenges were overcome


Motivation of software design choices

	- Why class structure/inheritance (explain hierarchy)
	- CRTP / static polymorphism
	- recognizing IP
	- callback function
	- implementation of intSplit (TU,UT, partial specialization)
	- polymorphism through enable_if
