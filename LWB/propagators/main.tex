\subsection{IntSplit using alternating templates}
\subsection{Static Polymorphism through CRTP and enable\_if}

\begin{comment}
The main achievement is that the algorithms can be implemented in a stunningly simple way

and that they are stunningly similar to the pseudo-algorithms of section \ref{sec:propagators}
even though they rely on highly optimized C++ code
\cite{libwaveblocks}
What was the main challenge? What was controllable (which code could be changed), what not? 
Quick alternating o

The challenges were twofold: 
First, identifying of all the common basic building blocks and expressing all algorithms in terms of these components
Second, implementing all basic building blocks in a generic but efficient manner
Third, minimize the overhead for switching between function calls

 - encapsulate the functionality in a clean interface without loosing flexibility and 
 - write efficient/fast code

Tell how each of these challenges were overcome


Motivation of software design choices

	- Why class structure/inheritance (explain hierarchy)
	- CRTP / static polymorphism \cite{C_CRTP}
	- recognizing IP
	- callback function
	- implementation of IntSplit (TU,UT, partial specialization)
	- polymorphism through enable-if
