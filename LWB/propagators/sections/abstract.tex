\begin{abstract}
	This article explains the central design decisions and most important code details related to the efficient implementation of time propagation for Hagedorn quantum wave packets in the WaveBlocks framework.
	A short introduction to operator splitting and a summary of some of the most important time propagation schemes for quantum wave packets are also given.
	The correctness of the implemented algorithms is confirmed by showing energy conservation plots.
	Finally, some benchmarking results are presented which compare different propagators, splitting schemes, step sizes and dimensionalities.
