	This article explains the central design decisions and most important code details related to the efficient implementation of time propagation for Hagedorn quantum wave packets in the WaveBlocks framework.
	A short introduction to operator splitting and a summary of some of the most important time propagation schemes for quantum wave packets are also given.
	Finally, some benchmarking results are presented in the context of an example of a ???Ddim Nlevel BLUB potential???.
